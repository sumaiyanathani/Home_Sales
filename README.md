# Home_Sales

In this challenge, SparkSQL was used to determine key metrics about home sales data. Spark was used to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached. A few questions about the dataset were also answered and runtimes between cached, uncached and partitioned tables were compared.
